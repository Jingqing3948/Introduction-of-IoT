- Automatic terminals are interconnected (自治终端互联化)
- Pervasive services are intelligent (普适服务智能化)

# Four-layer architecture model of IoT
- Object Sensing layer
- Data exchange layer
- Information integration layer
- Application service layer
# Three characteristics of IoT
- More Intensive Information Perception (更透彻的信息感知)
